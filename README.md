# idea-game

This is a just a POC to synchronize a game (client/server) with k-ramel actions only.

I had some issues like:
 - interpolation is not there
 - there is some gap between 2 clients
 - k-ramel serialized state was fat (this is fixed in k-redux-factory now)
 
 I opensource it now for curious people but I don't aim to update this project.
